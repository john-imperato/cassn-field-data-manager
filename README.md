# CA-SSN Field Data Manager

A Python desktop application for downloading, uploading, and managing wildlife image and audio data. Designed for the University of California Natural Reserve System (UCNRS) California Sentinel Sites for Nature (CASSN) team collecting standardized biodiversity data with camera traps and acoustic recorders across California.

## Features

- **Guided Workflow**: Step-by-step interface for SD card download and cloud storage upload across multi-plot, multi-device deployments
- **Standardized File Naming**: Files renamed to a consistent convention (`ORG_SITE_plotN_DEVTYPE_YYYYMMDD_SEQNO.ext`) for all devices. Camera images additionally encode trigger event and burst position (`EVENTNO_POS`) so photos from the same trigger are grouped.
- **Split Metadata CSVs**: Two CSVs written per deployment — `image_file_metadata.csv` (camera trap files) and `audio_file_metadata.csv` (AudioMoth recordings and config files). See the Metadata Schema section below for full field lists.
- **AudioMoth Parsing**: Recording schedule, gain, filter cutoff, and sample rate extracted from CONFIG.TXT; per-file battery voltage, temperature, and gain parsed from WAV comment headers.
- **Reconyx MakerNote Parsing**: Sequence position, trigger type (Motion/Time-lapse), sequence total, ambient temperature, moon phase, battery voltage, and battery type extracted directly from Reconyx HYPERFIRE HP4K EXIF MakerNote via ExifTool.
- **Device Identification**: Physical device IDs recorded per file. Camera serial numbers sourced from `cameras.csv`, AudioMoth device IDs parsed from CONFIG.TXT.
- **Timestamps**: `recorded_datetime` stored as ISO 8601 with UTC offset (e.g. `2025-12-04T15:48:05-08:00`), sourced from EXIF for cameras and AudioMoth filename for audio; DST-aware via `zoneinfo`
- **Deployment Records**: Deployment configuration and file manifest saved as JSON for each session.
- **Data Provenance**: Each metadata row records app version, processing timestamp, and Box upload status (uploader + datetime). Provenance CSVs are automatically re-uploaded to Box after the upload completes.
- **Data Integrity**: SHA-256 checksum recorded for each file, enabling corruption detection if needed.
- **Cloud Storage**: Automatic upload to Box with progress tracking and OAuth token refresh
- **Multi-Format File Support**: Images (JPG, PNG, TIF, RAW), audio (WAV, MP3, FLAC)
- **Configurable Lookup Tables**: Site, plot, and camera metadata loaded from local CSV files, making the app adaptable to other CASSN partners.
- **Wildlife Insights Export**: Generates deployment CSVs formatted for upload to Wildlife Insights from `image_file_metadata.csv`, using camera metadata from `cameras.csv` and `wi_config.json`.
- **SoundHub-Ready Audio Metadata**: `audio_file_metadata.csv` fields map directly to SoundHub deployment template columns — gain, filter cutoff (kHz), recording schedule, ARU hardware setup — so no field renaming is needed at submission time.
- **Session Persistence**: Interrupted downloads resume automatically. Previously copied files are skipped and sequence/event numbering continues correctly.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- pip package manager

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install PySide6 pillow piexif box-sdk-gen
```

### Download

Clone this repository or download the latest release:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/john-imperato/cassn-field-data-manager.git
cd cassn-field-data-manager
```

### Configure Box Credentials

Credentials to connect with your Box account are stored in `~/.cassn_credentials/`, a hidden folder in your home directory, outside the repo so they are never accidentally committed to version control.

Create the folder and config file:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.cassn_credentials
cp config.json.example ~/.cassn_credentials/config.json
```

Edit `~/.cassn_credentials/config.json` and add your Box application credentials:

```json
{
  "box": {
    "client_id": "YOUR_BOX_CLIENT_ID",
    "client_secret": "YOUR_BOX_CLIENT_SECRET",
    "target_folder_id": "YOUR_BOX_FOLDER_ID"
  }
}
```

Lock down the folder permissions so only you can read it:

```bash
chmod 700 ~/.cassn_credentials
chmod 600 ~/.cassn_credentials/config.json
```

**To get Box credentials:**
1. Go to https://app.box.com/developers/console
2. Create a new app (Custom App → OAuth 2.0)
3. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret
4. Navigate to the Box folder where you want data uploaded and copy the ID from the URL (e.g. `https://app.box.com/folder/123456789` → folder ID is `123456789`)

## Usage

### 1. Box Authentication (First Time Setup)

After configuring `~/.cassn_credentials/config.json`, authenticate with Box
using the utility script:

```bash
python3 utils/box_auth_setup.py
```

Follow the prompts to:
- Open the Box authorization URL in your browser
- Grant access to the application
- Paste the full redirect URL back into the terminal

This creates or refreshes `~/.cassn_credentials/box_tokens.json`, which enables automatic cloud uploads. No manual copy step is required. For detailed Box utility documentation, see [`utils/README.md`](utils/README.md). Box tokens expire after ~60 days of inactivity. Re-run the command above to refresh them.

### 2. Run the Application

```bash
python cassn_field_data_manager.py
```

### 3. Workflow

#### Step 1: Deployment Metadata
- Select UC as the organization
- Choose the reserve/site from dropdown (auto-complete enabled)
- Enter deployment start and end dates
- Select who is downloading the data
- Check which devices (ML, SA, BD, BT) for each plot
- Configure local staging location (default: `~/Desktop/CASSN_field_data_staging`)
- Enable/disable automatic Box upload

#### Step 2: Collect SD Card Data
- Insert SD card for each device
- Select the device from the list
- Click "Select SD Card & Copy Files" to copy, rename, and hash all files to local staging
- Repeat for all devices

#### Step 3: Review & Finalize
- Review deployment summary
- View file counts and sizes by device
- Files automatically upload to Box (if enabled)
- Open staging folder to verify
- Start new deployment or exit

### Wildlife Insights Deployment CSV

At the end of each session, the app automatically generates deployment CSVs formatted for upload to Wildlife Insights from `image_file_metadata.csv`, saved to `WI_metadata/` within the deployment folder. One CSV is produced per camera device type (ML, SA). Requires `cameras.csv` and `wi_config.json` to be populated in `local_data/`.

## Configuration

### Lookup Tables

The application requires real site and plot CSVs in the repo-local ignored
`local_data/` folder:

- `local_data/sites.csv`
- `local_data/plots.csv`
- `local_data/cameras.csv`
- `local_data/wi_config.json`
- `local_data/soundhub_config.json` — ARU hardware defaults (container type, microphone)
- `local_data/ARUs.csv` — Per-deployment ARU physical setup (mount height, substrate)

These files are not tracked by git and are intended for operational metadata,
including any sensitive plot information you do not want in a public repository.

The repo includes tracked example files in `example_data/` so you can create
your local copies:

- `example_data/sites.csv`
- `example_data/plots.csv`
- `example_data/cameras.csv`
- `example_data/wi_config.json`
- `example_data/soundhub_config.json`
- `example_data/ARUs.csv`

To create your private local copies:

```bash
mkdir -p local_data
cp example_data/sites.csv local_data/sites.csv
cp example_data/plots.csv local_data/plots.csv
cp example_data/cameras.csv local_data/cameras.csv
cp example_data/wi_config.json local_data/wi_config.json
cp example_data/soundhub_config.json local_data/soundhub_config.json
cp example_data/ARUs.csv local_data/ARUs.csv
```

**`cameras.csv`**: Camera serial numbers and Wildlife Insights metadata per plot. Columns include `camera_id` (physical serial number), `feature_type` (e.g. `Road dirt`, `Trail game`), `sensor_height`, `sensor_orientation`, `plot_treatment`, `plot_treatment_description`, and `detection_distance`.

**`wi_config.json`**: Wildlife Insights project IDs and upload defaults. Edit
`project_id_ML` and `project_id_SA` to match your project IDs in Wildlife Insights.

**`soundhub_config.json`**: Static ARU hardware defaults that apply to all deployments — `ARU_microphone`, `ARU_container_BD`, `ARU_container_BT`. Values are copied into `audio_file_metadata.csv` at processing time.

**`ARUs.csv`**: One row per `(deployment_event_id, site_code, plot_number, device_type)` recording physical ARU setup — `mounted_on`, `sensor_height_meters`, `ARU_status`. Add a row for each new deployment before or after processing.

Then edit the files in `local_data/`. Changes take effect on next app launch.

The application does not fall back to `example_data/` during normal operation.
Those files are templates only.

## Building the macOS App

To run as a double-clickable macOS `.app` (no terminal required):

```bash
bash build.sh
```

This will:
1. Install PyInstaller if needed
2. Convert the icon to macOS format
3. Bundle Python, all dependencies, assets, and example data into a self-contained `.app`
4. Output `dist/CASSN Field Data Manager.app`

Then install it:

```bash
sudo rm -rf "/Applications/CASSN Field Data Manager.app"
cp -r "dist/CASSN Field Data Manager.app" /Applications/
```

**Note:** `~/.cassn_credentials/config.json` and `~/.cassn_credentials/box_tokens.json` must be set up before launching the `.app`. The bundle does not include credentials.

To rebuild after code changes, run `bash build.sh` again and reinstall.
