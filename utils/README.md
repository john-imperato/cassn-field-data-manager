# CA-SSN Field Data Manager — Utilities

Helper scripts for maintenance and data recovery tasks.

---

## `box_auth_setup.py`

Runs the Box OAuth setup flow and writes reusable Box tokens to
`~/.cassn_credentials/box_tokens.json`.

### When to use

Use this script the first time you connect `cassn_field_data_manager.py` to Box,
or any time your saved Box tokens stop working and need to be refreshed.

### Requirements
```bash
pip install box-sdk-gen
```

You also need `~/.cassn_credentials/config.json` with your Box app
`client_id` and `client_secret`.

To verify `box-sdk-gen` is installed:

```bash
python3 -c "import box_sdk_gen; print('box-sdk-gen ok')"
```

### Setup

1. Confirm your Box credentials file exists:
   ```bash
   ls ~/.cassn_credentials/config.json
   ```
2. If `~/.cassn_credentials/config.json` does not exist, create it from the example file:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.cassn_credentials
   cp config.json.example ~/.cassn_credentials/config.json
   ```
3. Edit `~/.cassn_credentials/config.json` and add your Box app `client_id` and `client_secret`.

### Run
```bash
python3 utils/box_auth_setup.py
```

During the OAuth flow, `box_auth_setup.py` will:

1. Open your browser to the Box authorization page.
2. Ask you to log in and grant access.
3. Ask you to paste the full redirect URL back into the terminal.
4. Exchange that authorization code for tokens.
5. Save `box_tokens.json` to `~/.cassn_credentials/`.

### Output

On success, the script writes:

```text
~/.cassn_credentials/box_tokens.json
```

That token file is then used by:

- `cassn_field_data_manager.py`
- `recover_file_metadata.py`

### Notes

- If the script finds an existing token file, it tests that connection first
- If the existing token is invalid, it falls back to a fresh OAuth flow
- Refreshed tokens are written back to `~/.cassn_credentials/box_tokens.json` automatically
- The browser may redirect to a page that does not load; that is expected
- Paste the entire redirect URL, not just the authorization code

---

## `recover_file_metadata.py`

Recovers a deployment by downloading the full Box folder to the staging drive,
then regenerating:

- `file_metadata.csv`
- `manifest.json`
- `recovery_report.json`

### When to use

Use this script when a deployment was successfully uploaded to Box but the
local metadata artifacts were missing, incomplete, or need to be rebuilt.

### Requirements
```bash
pip install Pillow box-sdk-gen
```

Pillow is required. The script fails immediately if EXIF support is unavailable.

### Setup

1. Confirm Box credentials exist in `~/.cassn_credentials/`:
   - `config.json`
   - `box_tokens.json`
   ```bash
   ls ~/.cassn_credentials/config.json ~/.cassn_credentials/box_tokens.json
   ```
2. Open [`utils/recover_file_metadata.py`](/Users/johnimperato/GitHub/cassn-field-data-manager/utils/recover_file_metadata.py) and confirm the hard-coded recovery root matches your machine:
   - `RECOVERY_ROOT = Path("/Volumes/G-DRIVE ArmorATD/cassn-field-data-staging")`
   - Change this path if you want recovered deployments written somewhere else
   ```bash
   rg -n 'RECOVERY_ROOT' utils/recover_file_metadata.py
   ```
3. Confirm that recovery path exists and is writable on your machine.
   ```bash
   ls "/Volumes/G-DRIVE ArmorATD/cassn-field-data-staging"
   ```
4. Find the Box deployment folder ID from the Box URL:
   - `https://app.box.com/folder/123456789012`
   - Use the top-level deployment folder ID, not the `raw_data` subfolder ID
5. Confirm local plot metadata exists for label recovery:
   ```bash
   ls local_data/plots.csv
   ```

### Run
```bash
python3 utils/recover_file_metadata.py BOX_FOLDER_ID
```

Replace `BOX_FOLDER_ID` with the numeric deployment folder ID from Box. 

The script recovers exactly one deployment folder per run.

Progress is printed to the terminal as files are downloaded and processed.

Example terminal output during a live recovery run:

![Recovery progress](../screenshots/04-recover-file-metadata-progress.png)

### Output

The script creates a local recovery folder under:

```text
/Volumes/G-DRIVE ArmorATD/cassn-field-data-staging/<deployment-folder-name>/
```

That recovery folder contains:

- the downloaded Box deployment contents
- `file_metadata.csv`
- `manifest.json`
- `recovery_report.json`

If the deployment folder already exists locally, the script fails and does not overwrite it.

### Notes

- Authenticates using `~/.cassn_credentials/box_tokens.json` — no
  separate authentication step needed
- Downloads the entire deployment and preserves the Box folder structure
- Uses Box modified time for the recovered `timestamp` field
- Sets unrecoverable fields such as `original_filename` and `source_path` to `NA`
- Writes recovered outputs locally only; it does not upload `file_metadata.csv`
  or `manifest.json` back to Box
- Writes `recovery_report.json` even when the run completes with failures
- Uses `local_data/plots.csv` for plot-label lookup; `example_data/` files are templates only

---

## `generate_wi_deployments.py`

Generates Wildlife Insights deployment CSVs from CASSN deployment folders.

You can use it two ways:
- scan Box for deployment folders and generate WI CSVs in bulk, then upload them back to Box
- or process one local deployment folder for testing

For each deployment event, the script writes two CSVs into a `WI_metadata/`
subfolder:

- `wildlife_insights_ML_deployments.csv` — one row per ML (parallel) camera plot
- `wildlife_insights_SA_deployments.csv` — one row per SA (downward) camera plot

### When to use

- Run this after a deployment has already been uploaded to Box and you need the
  WI deployment CSVs.
- Use the local mode if you want to test one deployment folder before doing a
  broader backfill.
- If WI CSVs already exist in a deployment folder, the script skips that folder
  unless you use `--force`.

### Requirements

```bash
pip install box-sdk-gen
```

No extra dependencies beyond `box-sdk-gen`.

### Setup

This script depends on two local files in `local_data/`. These are gitignored on
purpose because they contain project IDs and camera serial numbers you do not
want committed.

#### 1. `local_data/cameras.csv`

Maps each site + plot + camera type to the camera used there, plus the few WI
fields this script needs. Create it from the example:

```bash
cp example_data/cameras.csv local_data/cameras.csv
```

#### 2. `local_data/wi_config.json`

Stores WI project IDs and a few deployment-level defaults. Copy the template and
fill in your values:

```bash
cp example_data/wi_config.json local_data/wi_config.json
```

To find your WI project ID: log in to [app.wildlifeinsights.org](https://app.wildlifeinsights.org),
open the project, and copy the number from the URL:
`wildlifeinsights.org/manage/projects/XXXXX`

### Run — Box mode (all deployments)

```bash
python3 utils/generate_wi_deployments.py
```

Traverses the Box deployment folders, downloads the deployment JSON files it
needs, generates the WI CSVs, and uploads them back to a `WI_metadata/`
subfolder in Box.

### Run — local mode (single deployment)

```bash
python3 utils/generate_wi_deployments.py --local PATH
```

Processes one local deployment folder. Writes WI CSVs to a `WI_metadata/` subfolder
inside that folder. Useful for testing before running against Box.

Example:

```bash
python3 utils/generate_wi_deployments.py --local '/Volumes/G-DRIVE ArmorATD/2026/UC_QuailRidge_20260108'
```

### Output

For each deployment event, the script creates or updates:

```text
<deployment-folder>/
└── WI_metadata/
    ├── wildlife_insights_ML_deployments.csv
    └── wildlife_insights_SA_deployments.csv
```

### Notes

- Authenticates using `~/.cassn_credentials/box_tokens.json` — no separate authentication step needed
- Only downloads `deployment_metadata.json` and `manifest.json` from Box; media files are never downloaded
- Audio device types (`BD`, `BT`) are ignored
- Missing `wi_config.json` causes the script to fail before writing output
- Missing `cameras.csv` causes warnings and blank camera-specific fields
- Existing WI CSVs are skipped unless you use `--force`
